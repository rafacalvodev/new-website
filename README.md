# Rafael Calvo

My brand new [website/portfolio](https:// rafacalvo.dev).

There are still things to add, which I will list below, but I think it is ready for the public.


## So, what's next?
Ehh, a few features ðŸ˜…  
**NOTE:** These ar not in any particular order, it's a list of the pending stuff I'll add.

- [ ] Blog posts! There are two blog posts there that need content. 
- [ ] Fill the about page.
- [ ] Dark-mode?
- [ ] Fix the feed page.
- [ ] Clean the Sass code.
- [ ] Optimize the images.
- [ ] Improve fonts load.


If I think of anything else, I'll add it to the list.
